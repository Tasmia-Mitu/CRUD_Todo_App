# restapi_todo

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

Project Description:
Developed a Flutter-based mobile application for managing tasks with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. The app interacts with a RESTful API to handle the backend operations. Users can add, view, update, and delete their tasks, and the app fetches and displays real-time data from a remote server. The app uses HTTP requests to communicate with the API, ensuring smooth data exchange in JSON format.

Key Features:

Create, read, update, and delete tasks
Real-time data fetching from REST API
User-friendly interface built using Flutter
Efficient data handling and state management
Responsibilities:

Designed and developed the entire Flutter application
Integrated REST API to handle CRUD operations

Ensured optimal performance and smooth user experience
